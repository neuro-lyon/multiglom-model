   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Multi-glomeruli Model's documentation!
=================================================

You will find here the documentation for the Multi-glomeruli model.
Most of the work was done during february to june 2013.

Where to start ?
----------------
If you want to *run simulations* I would suggest having a look at
:ref:`scripts`.

If you are a developper and want to extend the project, I would suggest to start
by looking at :ref:`model`, :ref:`scripts` and :ref:`workflow` first; then look
at :ref:`utilities` and :ref:`analyses`.
